- 👋 Hi, I’m @STAdvisory
- 👀 I’m interested in creating a greenhouse gas emissions calculator for small to medium size businesses uding Australian calculations.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python. I have an excel program that I want to convert and enhance to a program I can host on a server or program I can licence to people to login and use.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on this with a python writer maybe with streamlit or something also.  in the end I want a working program I can make changes to later, but initiially build the base of the programm.
- 📫 How to reach me c.mara@sustainabletransportadvisory.com  or message on here. I am new to github. I am a 1 person business but happy to work out a price for creating the tool for me.
